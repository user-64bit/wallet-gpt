# How to convert user's input to command

- user will write some random input and we will give it to llm and ask llm that what command should we run (from given list of commands)
- llm will give us the command and we will run it
- now we will trigger that command and we will get the output
- we will give that output to llm and ask llm to give us user friendly response
- then return response to user
